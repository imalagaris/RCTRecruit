Euclidean distance between prediction and actual recruitment

Description:

     Euclidean distance between prediction and actual recruitment

Usage:

     GetDistance(
       target,
       nSim = 10000L,
       fillGaps = FALSE,
       cauchyWt = FALSE,
       coeff = 1
     )
     
Arguments:

  target: A vector with the actual recruitment by week

    nSim: Number of simulations to run (default = 1e4L)

fillGaps: Whether to fill gaps in the data (default = FALSE)

cauchyWt: Whether to use Cauchy weights for sampling. If FALSE
          (default), binomial weights are used.

   coeff: A coefficient to apply to the recruitment rate (default = 1)

Value:

     An object of ‘RCTDist’ class with four elements.

       1. ‘dist’: A numeric vector with length equal to ‘nSim’
          containing the simulated Euclidean distance.

       2. ‘CI’: A numeric vector with the median and the 95% CI
          Euclidean distance.

       3. ‘call.’: The call (deparsed) that created the object

       4. ‘cargs’: A list with the arguments of the call that created
          the object including the default arguments
