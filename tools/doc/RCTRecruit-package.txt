RCTRecruit: Non-Parametric Recruitment Prediction for Randomized
Clinical Trials

Description:

     Accurate prediction of subject recruitment for randomized clinical
     trials (RCT) remains an ongoing challenge. Previous prediction
     models rely on parametric assumptions. We present functions for
     non-parametric RCT recruitment prediction under several scenarios.
