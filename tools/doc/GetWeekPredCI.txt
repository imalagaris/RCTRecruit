GetWeekPredCI            package:RCTRecruit            R Documentation

Calculate median recruitment with 95% CI for the next 52 weeks

Description:

     Calculate median recruitment with 95% CI for the next 52 weeks

Usage:

     GetWeekPredCI(nSim = 10000L, fillGaps = FALSE, cauchyWt = FALSE, coeff = 1)
     
Arguments:

    nSim: Number of simulations to run (default = 1e4)

fillGaps: Whether to fill gaps in the data (default = FALSE)

cauchyWt: Whether to use Cauchy weights for sampling (default = FALSE).
          If FALSE, binomial weights are used.

   coeff: A coefficient to apply to the recruitment rate (default = 1)

Value:

     An 52x3 matrix with the 2.5%, 50% and 97.5% percentiles for each
     week

Examples:

     LoadData(gripsYR1, ScreenDt, Enrolled)
     (res <- GetWeekPredCI(fillGaps = TRUE, coeff = 1.5))
     scenarios <- list(
       sc1 = GetWeekPredCI(),
       sc2 = GetWeekPredCI(cauchyWt = TRUE),
       sc3 = GetWeekPredCI(fillGaps = TRUE),
       sc4 = GetWeekPredCI(fillGaps = TRUE, coeff = 1.2)
     )
     maxY <- sapply(scenarios, \(x) x$pargs$maxY) |> max()
     
     graphics::par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
     for (x in scenarios) x$plot(yMax = maxY, Title = x$call.)
