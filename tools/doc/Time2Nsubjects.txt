Time2Nsubjects           package:RCTRecruit            R Documentation

Simulate number of weeks needed to recruit a given number of subjects

Description:

     Simulate number of weeks needed to recruit a given number of
     subjects

Usage:

     Time2Nsubjects(
       nSub = 50L,
       nSim = 10000L,
       fillGaps = FALSE,
       cauchyWt = FALSE,
       coeff = 1
     )
     
Arguments:

    nSub: Number of subjects to recruit (default = 50)

    nSim: Number of simulations to run (default = 1e4)

fillGaps: Whether to fill gaps in the data (default = FALSE)

cauchyWt: Whether to use Cauchy weights for sampling (default = FALSE).
          If FALSE, binomial weights are used.

   coeff: A coefficient to apply to the recruitment rate (default = 1)

Value:

     A ‘list’ with two elements. The first element ‘weeks’ is an
     integer vector with length equal to ‘nSim’ containing the results
     of the simulation. The second ‘CI’ shows the median and the 95%
     CI.

Examples:

     LoadData(gripsYR1, ScreenDt, Enrolled)
     res <- Time2Nsubjects()
     str(res)
