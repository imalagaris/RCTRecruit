Simulate number of weeks needed to recruit a given number of subjects

Description:

     Simulate number of weeks needed to recruit a given number of
     subjects

Usage:

     Time2Nsubjects(
       nSub = 50L,
       nSim = 10000L,
       fillGaps = FALSE,
       cauchyWt = FALSE,
       coeff = 1
     )
     
Arguments:

    nSub: Number of subjects to recruit (default = 50L)

    nSim: Number of simulations to run (default = 1e4L)

fillGaps: Whether to fill gaps in the data (default = FALSE)

cauchyWt: Whether to use Cauchy weights for sampling. If FALSE
          (default), binomial weights are used.

   coeff: A coefficient to apply to the recruitment rate (default = 1)

Value:

     An object of ‘RCTNWeeks’ class with four elements.

       1. ‘weeks’ is an integer vector with length equal to ‘nSim’
          containing the simulation results.

       2. ‘CI’ shows the median and the 95% CI.

       3. ‘call.’: The call (deparsed) that created the object

       4. ‘cargs’: A list with the arguments of the call that created
          the object including the default arguments
