Load recruitment data

Description:

     Load recruitment data

Usage:

     LoadData(data, date, enrolled)
     
Arguments:

    data: Main dataset containing at least two columns:

            * A ‘date’ column with the calendar date of the screening

            * A ‘enrolled’ column with the number of subjects enrolled

          If the entries cover a period longer than 1 year, only the
          entries within one year prior to the latest date will be
          retained.

    date: The name (symbol or string) of the column in the dataset with
          the calendar dates of active screening. The date column must
          be:

            * an object inheriting from class the ‘Date’ class

            * or a character vector with a valid date format.

enrolled: The name (symbol or string) of the column in the dataset with
          the number of subjects recruited on the corresponding date.
          It must be a numeric vector.

Value:

     This function does not return any value. It runs several tests and
     proccesses the data. It prints a message to the console if the
     data is successfully loaded or an error message if there is an
     issue with the input data. Once the dataset is loaded, the
     following functions can be used:

        * ‘Time2Nsubjects()’: simulates the number of weeks needed to
          recruit a given number of subjects

        * ‘GetDistance()’:calculates the Euclidean distance between the
          prediction and the actual recruitment

        * ‘GetWeekPredCI()’: calculates the median recruitment with 95%
          CI for the next 104 weeks (two years)

Examples:

     LoadData(gripsYR1, ScreenDt, Enrolled)     # Load using names as symbols
     LoadData(gripsYR1, "ScreenDt", "Enrolled") # Load using names as strings
     gripsYR1 |> LoadData(ScreenDt, Enrolled)   # Load using base pipe operator
     if (base::requireNamespace("magrittr", quietly = TRUE)) {
       # Load using magrittr pipe operator
       library(magrittr)
       gripsYR1 %>% LoadData(ScreenDt, Enrolled) # Load using base pipe operator
     }
