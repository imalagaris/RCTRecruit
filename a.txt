Euclidean distance between prediction and actual recruitment

Description:

     Euclidean distance between prediction and actual recruitment

Usage:

     GetDistance(
       target,
       nSim = 10000L,
       fillGaps = FALSE,
       cauchyWt = FALSE,
       coeff = 1
     )
     
Arguments:

  target: A vector with the actual recruitment by week

    nSim: Number of simulations to run (default = 1e4)

fillGaps: Whether to fill gaps in the data (default = FALSE)

cauchyWt: Whether to use Cauchy weights for sampling (default = FALSE).
          If FALSE, binomial weights are used.

   coeff: A coefficient to apply to the recruitment rate (default = 1)

Value:

     A list with two elements. The first element ‘dist’ is a numeric
     vector with length equal to ‘nSim’ containing the simulated
     Euclidean distance. The second ‘CI’ shows the median and the 95%CI
     Euclidean distance.

Examples:

     LoadData(gripsYR1, ScreenDt, Enrolled)
     res <- GetDistance(gripsWeeklyYR2$enrolled)
     str(res)
